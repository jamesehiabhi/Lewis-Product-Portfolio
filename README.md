### Introduction
This report analyzes sales data using PostgreSQL to identify the top-selling product by quantity in 2015. It applies SQL techniques like aggregations, CASE, COALESCE, and CAST to extract insights, handle missing values, and account for discounts. The queries provide a structured approach to sales analytics, making them valuable for data analysts and business professionals. Future enhancements include profitability analysis, query optimization, and data visualization. This report serves as a foundation for deeper business intelligence and database management insights. ðŸš€

### âœ¨Revenue generated from each product category.
**Objective:** To determine the revenue generated from each product category, considering different discount scenarios.

#### Methodology:
**1. Initial Revenue Calculation:**
- Calculate the total revenue for each product category without any discounts.

      select "ProductCategory", 
      		    sum("Price" * "Quantity") as revenue
      from orders
      join products on orders."ProductID" = products."ProductID"
      group by "ProductCategory";

**2. Discounted Revenue Calculation:**
- Apply a 10% discount for products priced above $100.
- Apply a 5% discount for products priced between $50 and $100.
- No discount for products priced below $50.

      select "ProductCategory", 
      		sum(case
      				when "Price" > 100 then "Price" * 0.9 * "Quantity"
      				when "Price" between 50 and 100 then "Price" * 0.95 * "Quantity"
      				else "Price" * "Quantity"
      				end) as "discounted revenue";

**Insights:**
- The analysis reveals the impact of discount strategies on revenue generation across different product categories.
- By comparing the initial and discounted revenues, we can identify which categories benefit most from discounting and which remain stable.

**Recommendations:**
- **Targeted Discounts:** Focus on applying discounts to categories that show significant revenue increases with discounts to boost sales.
- **Stable Categories:** Maintain pricing strategies for categories that remain stable, ensuring consistent revenue.

### âœ¨Total Revenue with Default Pricing for Null Values
**Objective**: To calculate the total revenue, treating products with a NULL price as having a default price of $10.

**Methodology:**
- Use the COALESCE function to replace NULL prices with $10.

      select sum(coalesce("Price", 10) * "Quantity")
      from orders
      join products on orders."ProductID" = products."ProductID";

**Insights:**
- This approach ensures that all products contribute to the total revenue, even if their prices are not specified.
- It provides a more comprehensive view of revenue generation, accounting for potential data gaps.

**Recommendations:**
- Data Quality Improvement: Ensure that product prices are consistently recorded to avoid reliance on default values.
- Revenue Assurance: Regularly review and update product pricing to reflect accurate revenue figures.

### âœ¨Order Analysis for the Year 2015
**Objective:** To determine the number of orders placed in the year 2015.

**Methodology:**
- Filter orders based on the order date falling within the year 2015.

      select count (distinct "OrderID")
      from orders
      where cast("OrderDate" as date) between '2015-01-01' and '2015-12-31';

**Recommendations:**
- Trend Analysis: Use historical order data to identify trends and forecast future demand.
- Marketing Strategies: Develop targeted marketing campaigns based on peak order periods.

### âœ¨Top-Selling Product in 2015
**Objective:** To identify the name and category of the top-selling product (in terms of quantity) in the year 2015.

**Methodology:**

      select "ProductName", "ProductCategory"
      from products
      join (
          select "ProductID", sum("Quantity") as total_quantity
          from orders
          where cast("OrderDate" as date) between '2015-01-01' and '2015-12-31'
          group by "ProductID"
          order by total_quantity desc
          limit 1
      ) as top_product
      on products."ProductID" = top_product."ProductID";

- Calculate the average price of these products.

      select 
      	coalesce(
      		cast(avg("Price") as text),
      		'All products were ordered')
      from products
